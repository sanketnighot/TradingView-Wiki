If you need to host the library files on a separate origin (domain) to the page
containing the chart then please ensure that the
[`library_path` widget constructor parameter](Widget-Constructor#library_path)
is configured as follows:

- The `library_path` value should start with either `http://` or `https://`,
  followed by the url to the folder containing the charting library's static
  files.
  - example: `library_path: 'https://example.com/charting_library/'`
- `library_path` should end with a trailing forward slash.

## Example: Loading the standalone version from separate origin

If you hosted the library files within a folder named `charting_library` on the
`example.com` domain then you would configure the library as follows.

### Loading the standalone script

Place the following script tag within the `<head>` of the page.

```html
<script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="https://example.com/charting_library/charting_library.standalone.js"
></script>
```

### Specifying the `library_path` parameter

When evoking the widget constructor, ensure that the `library_path` value starts
with `http` as described above.

```js
var widget = (window.tvWidget = new TradingView.widget({
    library_path: 'https://example.com/charting_library/',

    symbol: 'A',
    interval: '1D',
    container: 'tv_chart_container',
    datafeed: new Datafeeds.UDFCompatibleDatafeed(
        'https://demo_feed.tradingview.com'
    ),
}));
```

## Server setup

Make sure that the server hosting the library files is configured to allow
cross-origin requests from the origin of the page containing the chart element.
Please see this MDN article for more information:
[Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin)

### Demo Charts and Study Templates Storage Server

Please note that the
[demo charts and study template storage server](Saving-and-Loading-Charts#using-demo-charts-and-study-templates-storage)
(`http://saveload.tradingview.com`) isn't compatible with requests from any
origin except `localhost` and `tradingview.com`. Attempting to use this server
from any other origin will still result in a CORS error.

Please see [Saving and Loading Charts](Saving-and-Loading-Charts) for an
overview on how to setup your own storage server.
